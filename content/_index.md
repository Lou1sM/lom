I'm a postdoc (officially, 'postdoctoral research associate') in the School of Informatics, at the University of Edinburgh. I recently completed my PhD at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz, focussing on deep learning and unsupervised machine learning. Currently, I'm working on vision-language learning with Prof. Mark Steedman and Prof. Mirella Lapata. I've also done some work on semantic representations and cross-lingual semantics in computational linguistics.
