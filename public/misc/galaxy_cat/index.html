      <p>Perhaps the reason housecats are the most popular pet in the world today is that they combine the grace and confidence of an apex predator with the frailty and softness of completely domesticated species. In that sense, they are opposite of humans&ndash;we are, pragmatically, the most dominant apex predator in the planet&rsquo;s history but still have the fear-based mindset of prey and scavengers. So, although we are drawn to cats partly from our caring instinct for a creature who needs our help, we are also allured by their poise and presence&ndash;some part of us will always defer to them, and we can never shake the feeling that they have something or know something that we do not.</p>
<p>This barrelly little munchkin, Galaxy Cat, lies clumsily sideways, exposing its pudgy underbelly, while also carrying the mysteries of the universe on its back.</p>
