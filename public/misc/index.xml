Its ripples and ruffles rejoin and divide, In numberless pieces, its masses collide. It takes many faces, it grows many eyes, Its voices in chorus extend to the skies. Though reaching for beauty, these voices are lost, Their hearts are divided, their purposes crossed.</description></item><item><title>Galaxy Cat</title><link>https://lou1sm.github.io/louismahonville/misc/galaxy_cat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lou1sm.github.io/louismahonville/misc/galaxy_cat/</guid><description>Perhaps the reason housecats are the most popular pet in the world today is that they combine the grace and confidence of an apex predator with the frailty and softness of completely domesticated species. In that sense, they are opposite of humans&amp;ndash;we are, pragmatically, the most dominant apex predator in the planet&amp;rsquo;s history but still have the fear-based mindset of prey and scavengers. So, although we are drawn to cats partly from our caring instinct for a creature who needs our help, we are also allured by their poise and presence&amp;ndash;some part of us will always defer to them, and we can never shake the feeling that they have something or know something that we do not.</description></item></channel></rss>
